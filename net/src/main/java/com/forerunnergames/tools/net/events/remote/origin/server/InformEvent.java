/**
 * Represents pseudo-request events sent by the server to a client which may contain information that the client must
 * respond to, but has the freedom to respond with various types of client requests, instead of just a single type.
 * Should be answered by an {@link InformRequestEvent}, which the server should then answer with a {@link SuccessEvent}
 * or {@link DeniedEvent}, but NOT a {@link ResponseSuccessEvent} NOR a {@link ResponseDeniedEvent}.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * To simplify understanding, imagine the server is telling a client, "I'm going to inform you of what's going on, and
 * you can decide what kind of request (out of several valid options) you'd like to make based on that information. I'll
 * then answer your request with either success or denial."
